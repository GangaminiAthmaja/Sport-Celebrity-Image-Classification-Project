# Sport-Celebrity-Image-Classification-Project
Sport Celebrity Image Classification | Machine Learning | Image Classification


Developed an image classification model that accurately identifies celebrities by their facial features. 


The project involved preprocessing images using OpenCV, performing face and eye detection, and applying Wavelet Transform (Discrete Wavelet Transform - DWT) for feature extraction. 




Combined raw pixel data with wavelet features to train a machine learning model, utilizing techniques like Haar cascades for object detection and PyWavelets for feature extraction. 



The model was built using Python and achieved efficient performance with a structured dataset of celebrity images.
